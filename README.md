## Project Overview

This is a collection of passages that I highlighted as I read "The Creative Act: A Way of Being" by Rick Rubin. I kept finding inspiration in these short passages and I found myself wanting to refer to them. I found myself wanting to share them with my creative friends. 

So I created this next.js web app to serve up the passages I highlighted from the book. Every creative should read this book. It's my hope that these passages inspire other creators and encourage them to read the full book.
